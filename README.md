## Document Overview

This README accompanies the R Markdown document titled "GENE EXPRESSION ANALYSIS AND INTERPRETATION" authored by Gbolahan Adeleke, created on 2023-12-16.
The document contains several R code chunks for data processing and analysis in the context of a bioinformatics study. Below is a detailed breakdown of the code chunks and their functionalities.

## R Code Chunks Description

### 1. Setup Chunk
- *Purpose:* Global setting for knitr to display R code with its output in the document.
- *Code:* knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

### 2. Data Extraction Chunk
- *Purpose:* Extracts and lists the contents of a specified tar.gz file.
- *Code Details:* Defines paths, checks for directory existence, creates directory if not present, extracts the tar.gz file, and lists extracted files.

### 3. Data Import Chunk
- *Purpose:* Imports RNA sequencing, clinical, and CNA data from text files.
- *Code Details:* Reads data files using read.table with specified headers and separators.

### 4. RNA Seq Data Preprocessing Chunk
- *Purpose:* Removes duplicate rows from RNA sequencing data.
- *Code Details:* Identifies and keeps unique rows in the dataset.

### 5. ERBB2 Analysis Chunk
- *Purpose:* Identifies and visualizes the ERBB2 gene in the CNA dataset.
- *Code Details:* Locates the ERBB2 index, and plots a histogram for its distribution.

### 6. Matching Patients Chunk
- *Purpose:* Matches and subsets patients in RNA sequencing data with CNA data.
- *Code Details:* Identifies common patients between datasets and subsets RNA data.

### 7. Sanity Checks and Data Preparation Chunks
- *Purpose:* Various checks and preparations for ERBB2 analysis.
- *Code Details:* Includes sanity checks, pre-allocation of memory for ERBB2, and data transformations.

### 8. DESeq2 Analysis Chunks
- *Purpose:* Normalizes data and performs differential gene expression analysis.
- *Code Details:* Installs and loads DESeq2, normalizes data, and extracts significant genes.

### 9. Volcano Plot Chunks
- *Data Visualization:* Creates volcano plots to visually represent gene expression data.

### 10. Enrichment Analysis Chunks
- *GO and KEGG Enrichment Analysis:* Performs enrichment analysis using ClusterProfiler and KEGG databases.
- *Results Visualization:* Plots dotplots and barplots to visualize enrichment analysis results.

### 11. ClusterProfiler Analysis Chunks
- *Purpose:* Performs Gene Ontology enrichment analysis.
- *Code Details:* Installs necessary packages, performs GO enrichment analysis on significant genes.

### 12. Variance Stabilizing Transformation and PCA Plot Chunks
- *Purpose:* Data transformation and visualization.
- *Code Details:* Performs variance stabilizing transformation and creates a PCA plot.

### 13. Hierarchical Clustering Chunk
- *Purpose:* Performs hierarchical clustering and assigns clusters to the data.
- *Code Details:* Clusters genes or samples and visualizes the dendrogram.
